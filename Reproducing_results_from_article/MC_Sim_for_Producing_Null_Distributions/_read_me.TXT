Functions for plotting the normality of the WN IFCMs and the phase-ransomised FT and IAAFT IFCMs are also provided.
The WN IFCMs don't need to be normal, because only the mean value is being used. However, it is interesting that 
low-low scale IFCs are often significantly non-normal in WN IFCMs. This may be due to the CLT under m-dependence.
